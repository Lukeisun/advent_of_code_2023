This solution is more of a translation based off of Johnathan Paulson's [python solution](https://youtu.be/iqTopXV13LE?si=Mvcbc2JFKujNz-w5).

My original solve was commit `51e41f6`. Which took a _while_. I still don't fully grok this solution, the range
manipulation appears to be really hard (at least to me).
